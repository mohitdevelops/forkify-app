# JavaScript Learning Project

**Overview**

This project is a practical application of JavaScript concepts learned through a Udemy course. While the core business logic was provided, I actively participated in the code-along sessions, implementing various features and gaining hands-on experience.

**Key Features**

* **Dynamic UI Updates:** Dynamically update the UI based on user input.
* **Custom Event Handling:** Implement custom event listeners for specific interactions.
* **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Use asynchronous functions to fetch data from APIs.

**Technologies Used**

* **JavaScript:** Core language for all project functionalities
* **HTML:** Structure of the web pages
* **CSS:** Styling of the web pages
